# MONEY!!!

## or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the Token

???

Who wants to talk about money??

# Money is a Technology

.left-column.width-66[

A really powerful one:
* Probably as old as fire
* Facilitates trade
* Integral to our daily experience
* Allows us to operate outside of small communities
* Really attractive to counterfeit

*That's why governments control it*

Not too long after the invention of fire, someone created the concept of money.

It's a brilliant concept, basically someone decided that certain tokens with
some weird symbols on it was to be considered valuable, and people used that
to trade a certain number of goats for a certain amount of corn.
It let people move on from the complex relationships of barter in trade to
a vastly simplified system where everything could be priced in terms of this
weird, made-up coin. Since everything had a price, and the prices were all
in the same system, this made it really easy to conduct trade with people
in a community.

Not too long after that, someone decided to make their own look-a-like coins
and tried to pass them off to their neighbors as genuine tokens.
People are always gaming the system. It's an arms race!

# Bitcoin is Money

.left-column.width-66[

*Magic Internet Money!*

But, what is Money?
* Unit of Account (anyone can get a Bitcoin address)
* Store of Value (Well, *some* value. It fluctuates)
* Medium of exchange (You have to pay a fee, but...)

Most importantly... it's super easy to make my own Bitcoin!

... but that doesn't mean anyone cares!

*Wait, there's phyisical Bitcoins?*

*I thought you said it was digital?*

Bitcoin was the first experiment in the creation of a digital currency that
is able to be used just like money, but without the need for centralized power
to secure it and prevent counterfeiting.

It relies on the principles of cryptography and fault-tolerant networking
to enable a distributed ledger of who owns what coins.

Think of Bitcoin as the Internet's Treasury Department. It sets the rules of
the monetary supply, as well as defines the conditions under how it can be
transferred. It doesn't set the value, the value is defined by it's users in
the global marketplace, and the price they are willing to pay (in their own
native currencies) for a truly global digital currency that is resistant to
attacks, denial of service, and counterfeiting.

# Ethereum is *not* Money

.left-column.width-66[

Ethereum is a platform that allows you to create your own money!

...as well as other valuable digital agreements:
* Tokens (ERC-20 Standard)
* ICOs (Crowdsale events)
* Dapps (May use Tokens for operation)
* DAOs (May use Tokens to enable governance)

It has a native coin called *ether*, used to execute transactions

Ethereum is a Platform that allows anyone to create their own valuable digital
goods, through public digital agreements called *smart contracts*.
A smart contract is pretty much like a regular legal contract, it can be written
by pretty much anyone and say pretty much anything, but it only has meaning
when people use it to facilate commerce.

Ethereum smart contracts are enforced by the *EVM*, which is a distributed, global
computer that executes smart contracts through transactions. In order to excecute
a transaction, Ethereum has it's own native currency called *ether* which is used
to pay for the execution of that transactions on the network. Ether could be said
to be a currency that draws it's value primarily from it's usage as the payment
for transactions fees.

# Ethereum is *programmable* Money!

.left-column.width-50[

Anyone can make a token... but, who cares?!

It's all about use cases
* Utility tokens
    * Access to a resource
    * Debt
    * Fees
    * Licenses
* Security tokens
    * DAO voting rights
    * Collatoralized debt
* Collectibles
    * Digital collectibles
    * Phyiscal collectibles (certificates)

A big use case of Ethereum as a platform is for creating smart contracts that
encapsulate valuable quantities such as tokens. These units of value derieve
their value from their use cases. Anyone can make their own token or even directly
copy another one that already exists, no one will care.

The context matters. If everyone is using one token contract to facilate the trading
of some sort of asset, that is the only one that matters.
If you can only pay the fee for executing that transaction in another token,
that's the only token that matters.

If I make some sort of provably rare digital animal, let's say a kitten, and it
has certain attributes that only one person could ever have ownership over in
that one smart contract, and that same contract facilates the thousands of others
to own their own provably rare digital kitten, who's to say what the value of that is?

There's no secret to magic internet money...

It still requires:
* Solving problems
* Hard work
* Listening
* Transparency
* Communication
* Marketing
* ...and a little bit of luck!

But first and foremost, you have to `#BUIDL` the thing!

So, you might be saying to yourself
"Where do I sign up?? How do I make millions and buy myself a Lambo??"

Well, prepare to be dissapointed!

There's no secret to success in the Crypto world.
Those who found themselves to have long term success did so because they followed
the basic tenants of being an entrepeneur. Namely, they solved a customer's problem
with technology through hard work, listening, transparency, great communication,
good marketing, and, of course, a little bit of luck.
The problem being solved may not have even been known to be a problem
(I think that resonates with a lot of people when we think about Crypto and Money)
but if it has no use case, it has no value, and therefore will never have long term success.

This goes double for the underlying technologies like Ethereum we leverage for building
our applications with: if we don't show that the platform enables the ability to solve
a host of our world's problems through imaginative new technologies, that 1 ETH you're
holding on to might as well be 1 share of MySpace's stock in 2005.

I mean, it's worth something, but it failed to deliver on it's promises to change the world.

Okay, enough preaching, hopefully you're convinced to use your superpowers for good and #BUIDL.

Today we're going to learn about Smart Contract development with Solidity,
the most popular Smart Contract language Ethereum uses (currently).

It's deceptively simple to learn, 90% of the knowledge you need to develop dapps that use
smart contracts have nothing to do with smart contracts themselves, but how they're used.

Once you can design smart contracts, you'll need to learn how to package them into dapps.
In order for those dapps to be useful and gain traction, you will need to understand how
economics comes into play, as well as how to design them to maintain the right properties
in your network of users.

Lastly, any sufficiently large dapp needs to start to think about Governance structures,
particular Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and how they form an integral part of
your dapp and value proposition.

Today's workshop will be the first step towards understanding this new paradigm of application
development, and particularly where you will fit moving forward. Hopefully some of you
will see the power and responsibility in this approach, and join the conversation, lending
your voice towards this community of dapp developers in order to build new solutions for the world!

# Let's shill some coins!

.left-column.width-66[
Develop an ICO smart contract that earns you the most ShillTokens

Rules:
* There are no rules, winner takes all!
* Yes, you can talk or strategize with others
* Yes, you can exploit other's smart contracts
* Yes, you can ask for help!
* Yes, this is pure, unadulterated capitalism

Suggestions:
* Be transparent (transparency ==> trust ==> users)
* Be nice! (see above)
* Market your ICO! (No one said you can't)

# Ready to Rumble!
.left-column.width-66[
* Download the 'SampleICO.sol' contract from [github.com/DappDevs/coin-workshop](https://github.com/DappDevs/coin-workshop/blob/master/contracts/SampleICO.sol)
* Upload it to remix
    * Use the Javascript VM instead of Rinkeby
* Make sure to throughly test your modifications
* Make sure it works with the ICO interface, and with the ERC20 interface

Set an alarm, and go around the room

Deploy and Publish Token contract to Rinkeby

---

# Deploy!
.left-column.width-66[
* Make sure to deploy to Rinkeby
* Log the `RegisterICO(token_address)` event
    * So we know the location of your contract
* Make sure to fund your ICOs with both Tokens and Ether
    * Otherwise people can't interact with it
* You are allowed to talk
    * But don't yell... or be mean

You will have 20 mins to get as many Tokens as possible... GO!

# Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!
.left-column.width-66[
* Navigate to [rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/[token_address]]()
* Whoever has the most tokens wins!

# Debrief
* What issues did people have
* Any bugs, locked tokens, locked funds?
* What worked technically? Socially?
* Did anyone hack another ICO? The token contract?

Figure out winner based on Token contract on Etherscan

Ask if anyone had problems, questions, etc.

When things wrap up, let everyone network for a bit and decompress

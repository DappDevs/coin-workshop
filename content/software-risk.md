"Uhhh, guys I think I did this..." - Parity bug, locking $230m User funds permanently

Happened due to lack of understanding around software risk,
and lack of adequete process for release.

Only way to undo a software bug in Ethereum is hard fork, so plan ahead!

How many of you have written software?

How many of you have written more than 1000 lines of code?

How many of you have found a bug in that code while using it?

How many of you have lost $230 million because you found a bug in that code?

Writing software is hard. only 0.2% of the population has the skills necessary to write
moderately complex software, the sorts of software we are used to seeing every day.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of that software is written with the "move fast and break things"
mindset, which will simply not work for Dapps leveraging Smart Contracts on the Blockchain

A successful DappDev will need to understand how to not only identify and fix software issues,
but quantify risk in software systems to determine when it is appropiate to launch a fix.

They will also need to understand how to build in adequete safeguards and mitigations for potential issues.
It's not enough to just hit the emergency stop on a business moving millions of dollars a day.
You will need to work on methods to work around most issues that might pop up,
and design in means of protecting against behavior that is deterimental to your platform.

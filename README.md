2. Create a Metamask DEN to get an Ethereum Address
3. Check out the [Remix Online IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/). Deploy something. Play with it.
4. Go to [Rinkeby Test Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) to request funds through your social media account

Concept is:
1. Deploy Token, hand out 100 to each person
2. Show them the sample ICO contract (as an example)
3. Have them create their own and post the deployed address
4. Have everyone in the room buy/sell tokens with each other's ICOs
5. Wait for it... (10-20 mins)
6. Whoever has the most tokens wins!
7. Review lessons learned live on the blockchain (losses, hacks, etc.)
